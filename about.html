    <h2>Hello, I'm Chinmayi Sri Mannem</h2>

    <p>
        I am an engineering student with a strong interest in software development
        and building real-world applications across multiple platforms.
    </p>

    <p>
        I enjoy working on web applications, backend systems, and problem-solving
        projects that involve logical thinking, system design, and user-focused solutions.
    </p>

    <p>
        My goal is to continuously improve my technical skills and contribute to
        impactful software projects in both academic and professional environments.
